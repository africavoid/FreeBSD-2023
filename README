These are my personal dotfiles, I suggest you dont use them directly just yet as im working on a script to seamlessly install it all but thats a work in progress.
Right now it's probably a bit janky and a pretty manual install.
But if you're here and planning on using my dotfiles thank you and good luck.

If you're trying to use the suckless utils on FreeBSD just copy the config.mk.freebsd file to config.mk and it should compile fine
